#Abstarct: solve the problem that android x86 can not starts graphical desktop on qemu

1. try the iso image again on other hypervisor platforms to make sure the image is ok, such as virtuabox.

2. run qemu with option '-vga std' to try again.

Note: vga is a universal display dirver which can support most graphics cards.
