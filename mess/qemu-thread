#Abstract: qemu thread

qemu threads:
	thread name	location	parent	work
	main		vl.c		null	dispatch events in a loog
	call_rcu	util/rcu.c	main	unknown ...
	worker		thread-pool.c	main	deal with io request
	CPU N/KVM	cpus.c		main	wait for io events in a loop

virtio-blk:
	resolve and dispatch io request in main thread

dataplane:
	It create dataplane thread based on iothread.c? I can not run it, so I am not sure how it works.

plan:
	create threads like CPU N/KVM thread to wait specific events dispatched by main thread
